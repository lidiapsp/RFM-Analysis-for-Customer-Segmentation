## 📊 RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation Using Python

## 🧠 Project Overview  
This project uses **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** combined with demographic and behavioral data to segment customers. The goal is to identify profitable segments, understand customer behaviors, and tailor marketing strategies to improve retention and sales.

Analysis was performed in **Python**, with results summarized in reports and interactive notebooks.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Segment customers based on demographics, activity, and purchasing patterns  
- Analyze the relationship between promotions and sales  
- Recommend strategies for targeting and re-engaging customers  

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn/Matplotlib)  
- Google Colab Notebook  
- EDA and RFM segmentation  

## 📁 Files  
- pptx: Summary of analysis and recommendations  
- ipynb: Interactive Python notebook  

## 📌 Key Insights  
- **Boomers** and **Gen-X** are the most profitable customer groups  
- Promotions are effective but must be optimized in frequency (~6–9 times/year)  
- High overall retention rate, but a subset of customers remain inactive  

## 💡 Recommendations  
- Target high-value segments (**Boomers, Gen-X**) with personalized offers  
- Re-engage **inactive customers** through tailored promotions  
- Optimize promotion frequency to avoid diminishing returns
